# Covid-Data-Analysis-Using-Tableau

**Summary Of the Project**
This project involves an in-depth analysis of COVID-19 trends using Tableau for interactive visual representation. The goal was to track the pandemic's impact globally and uncover key insights into cases, deaths, and recovery trends over time.

**Project Overview**
This Tableau dashboard provides a comprehensive view of COVID-19 trends using interactive visualizations. The analysis includes total cases, deaths, and recovery rates, along with country-wise comparisons and time-based trends.

**Key Metrics & Insights:**

1. Total COVID-19 Cases:

>> Analyzed the total number of reported cases globally.

>> Identified trends over time to observe spikes and decline periods.

2. Total Deaths & Mortality Rate:

>> Examined the total deaths and case fatality rate (CFR) per region.

>> Compared mortality trends across countries to identify high-risk regions.

3. Total Recoveries & Recovery Rate:
   
>> Assessed recovery trends across different regions.

>> Identified patterns in recovery rates vs. new cases to measure pandemic control.

4. Country-wise Analysis:

>> Compared COVID-19 impact by country using bar charts and maps.

>> Identified the most affected regions based on cases, deaths, and recoveries.

5. Time-Series Analysis:

>> Tracked the evolution of the pandemic using line charts.
>> Analyzed daily and monthly trends to observe peak periods and slowdowns.

6. Data Cleaning & Preparation:

>> Processed and structured the raw COVID-19 dataset for accurate reporting.

>> Used Power Query (if applicable) for data transformation before visualization.
